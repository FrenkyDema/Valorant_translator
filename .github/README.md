Welcome to the application of modification of the Valrant language. This app allows you to change the language of the Valrant game texts with one of the supported languages, simply by selecting the desired language from the drop -down menu. In addition, the app automatically detects the language currently set in the game. In order for the app to work correctly, it will be necessary to select the Valarant installation folder, and make sure that the Riot client is open while using the app.

## Usage

1. Download the application's .exe file from the "Releases" section of the project's GitHub repository.
1. Double-click the .exe file to launch the application.
1. Enter the path to the Valorant folder (where the language files are located) in the application's configuration window.
1. Select the desired language from the list of supported languages in the application's main window.
1. Verify that the Valorant Riot client is open. If it is not, open the Riot client for the application to function properly.
1. Click the "Translate" button to modify Valorant's text files with the selected language.
